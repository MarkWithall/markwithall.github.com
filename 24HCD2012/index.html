        <h1>24 Hour Comics Day 2012 (Saturday October 20th 2012)</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction - 09:59</h2>
        <p>Today I'm randomly doing <a href="http://www.24hourcomicsday.com/">24 Hour Comics Day</a>.  The goal is to create a 24 page comic in 24 hours (or, in my case, before I fall asleep).  I shall primarily be drawing the comic book in Sketchbook Pro on the iPad.  Hopefully, updates will be posted here regularly throughout the day.</p>
        
        <h2>11:27</h2>
        <p>A rather slow start.  I've decided to just start drawing and see where the comic book goes.  Here is the first page.</p>

        <h2>12:48</h2>
        <p>Still behind schedule.  No plot yet.</p>

        <h2>14:30</h2>
        <p>Delayed by the arrival of lunch.  A second character has arrived that clearly needs rescuing by our hero Bob.</p>

        <h2>17:03</h2>
        <p>After several hours of aimless doodling, I'm going to call time.  Lack of ideas and ability to draw and particularly lack of ability to colour have left me too far behind.  I shall try to spend more time over the next year learning to draw and paint and see if I'm in a better position for next year's event.</p>
