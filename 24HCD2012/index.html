        <h1>24 Hour Comics Day 2012 (Saturday October 20th 2012)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction - 09:59</h2>
        <p>Today I'm randomly doing <a href="http://www.24hourcomicsday.com/">24 Hour Comics Day</a>.  The goal is to create a 24 page comic in 24 hours (or, in my case, before I fall asleep).  I shall primarily be drawing the comic book in Sketchbook Pro on the iPad.  Hopefully, updates will be posted here regularly throughout the day.</p>
        <h2>11:27</h2>
        <p>A rather slow start.  I've decided to just start drawing and see where the comic book goes.  Here is the first page.</p>
