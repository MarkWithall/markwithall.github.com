title: iOS Audio Playback - What Does 2x Mean?
description: Do the speed multipliers in various iOS apps actually change the speed as they say?

For quite some time it has bugged me that selecting 2x in the Music app on iOS doesn't play back the selected audio in half the time.  I have, therefore, taken the time to measure the playback time in my two most used apps: Apple Podcasts and Audible.

The experiment was simple: play 1 minute of audio at each of the different speed options and time them.  The results were as follows (times are only approximate, as they were manually timed using my wristwatch).

* Podcasts Hair (2x): 41s
* Podcasts Tortoise (0.5x): 1m19s
* Audible 1.5x: 48s
* Audible 2x: 41s
* Audible 3x: 31s

This doesn't really shed any light on the naming of the speed options but at least I can now judge roughly how long it will take to play an audio file of a given length at each of the speeds.
