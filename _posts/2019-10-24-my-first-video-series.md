Just over a year ago, I decided to try my hand at recording a programming video. Rather surprisingly, this turned into me recording a series of 38 episodes, with each episode being around 20 to 30 minutes in length, and a total duration of 16.5 hours.

The subject of the video series was [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer). The reason being that I was into assembly language programming at the time. I also took the opportunity to try out C++17. It had been a number of years since I last programming C++ in anger, so this seemed like a good opportunity to get myself back up to speed.

I recorded using [OBS](https://obsproject.com), as that seems to be what most people use for this purpose and it seems to have produced good quality videos. Unfortunately, due to not having mastered the process early on, the first 7 episodes have quite a low volume. Later episodes have much better sound. YouTube appear to be in the process of overhauling their editing tools, so it's not currently straightforward to fix the volume. Hopefully, I can come back and sort it out later.

If you happen to have a spare couple of days, feel free to check out my efforts [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL138JwO5B4Luodhg5HhxG6dLd6kcWg1a1).
