title: 2013 Programming Articles Review
categories: programming
---
At the beginning of each year I like to set myself some goals for the coming twelve months.  Last year (2013), I decided I wanted to blog more.  In particular, I wanted to write more about programming.  One of the main reasons for this was that I wanted to give myself some practice at explaining my thought process; an area in which I’ve not always excelled in the past.

Over the year, I managed to write nine articles, on a fairly diverse set of programming topics.  While I fell short of my ‘one a month’ goal, I still consider this a success.  I suppose, as with most new year’s resolution type things, it was inevitable that it would tail off in the second half of the year.

This year (2014), I have decided to try again at twelve articles over the year.  Hopefully, I will at least beat the nine of last year.  Of course, I’ve decided to cheat and give myself a head start by writing this article about last years articles.  I also have a couple of half finished articles from last year, which should also help.

In addition to writing more articles, I’d like to record a couple of live coding videos for youtube, in the areas of TDD and MVVM, based on a few of last year’s articles.  I also want to write the simple blog commenting system that’s been on the todo list for quite some time.

To finish, here is a list of links to the articles from 2013.  I think my favourite was probably The World’s Simplest C# WPF MVVM Example; the [code for which](https://github.com/MarkWithall/worlds-simplest-csharp-wpf-mvvm-example) has been forked and starred a number of times on github.  I’m planning a follow up to this article where I look into extreme decoupling of the parts of an MVVM application to see just how far one can go.

Wish me luck!
