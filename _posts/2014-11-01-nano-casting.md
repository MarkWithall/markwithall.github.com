It's that time of year again.  This year I have decided to do a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, loosely based on a certain murder mystery board game.

To fit the structure of my story (which I will hopefully detail in a later article, if I can persuade myself to do so), I need to have 7 male and 7 female characters.  This works out at one pair for each room on the board (yes, I know there are 9 rooms in the real game but I did say loosely).

Below is the current casting of each pair of characters.  I shall endeavour to update the list as I decide upon further characters.

## Library
* Earl Gray: [Anthony Hopkins](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/)
* Lady Gray: [Lucy Lawless](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005128/)
* Master Gray: [Michael Pitt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0685856/)

## Conservatory
* Mr Ruby: [Max Martini](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0242882/)
* Mrs Ruby: [Christina Hendricks](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376716/)

## The Cellar
* Father Jade:[Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/)
* Sister Mary Leaf: [Michelle Trachtenberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005502/)

## Kitchen
* Mr Ivory: [Idris Elba](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/)
* Mrs Ivory:[Amber Heard](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/)

## Ballroom
* Professor Pear: [Jack Nicholson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/)
* Professor Pear: [Jeanne Tripplehorn](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000675/)

## Dining Room
* Commandant Dijon: [Vincent Cassel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001993/)
* Mme Dijon: [Monica Bellucci](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000899/)

## Lounge
* Mr Pheasant: [Edward Norton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570/)
* Mrs Pheasant: [Angelina Jolie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/)

## Everywhere
* The Butler: [Clive Owen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654110/)
* The Maid: [Alexandra Breckenridge](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1020036/)

I shall also add which rooms they are in once I've decided.  Happy NaNoing!
