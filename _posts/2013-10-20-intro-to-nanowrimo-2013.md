title: Introduction To NaNoWriMo 2013
categories: nano2013

This November I will be doing [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/scroog1/) for the fifth time.

I've decided this year to write a political satire based in the near future.  In the story an extreme right-wing party gets into power after an unusually large number of protest votes.  Needless to say, hilarity ensues.

The main story will revolve around a number of new laws and policies that will be introduced during the term.  These will include such things as the following:
* a new speed camera system that utilises satellite technology to monitor all cars all the time
* unemployed people being automatically given work by the government to earn their benefits; resulting in much cleaner towns and cities and other side effects
* an increase in the minimum age for smoking by one year every year

Other policies that will be addressed will include business, education and, of course, foreign policy and immigration.

I have no idea where all of this will end up but it should provide much entertainment for the month of November.

See you all at the TGIO.
