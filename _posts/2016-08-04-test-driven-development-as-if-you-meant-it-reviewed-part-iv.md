This article was written with and is [also published by](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/articles/test-driven-development-as-if-you-meant-it-reviewed-part-4/) Matthew Atkinson.

We’ve taken a detailed look, in the previous part, at how to get started with TDDAIYMI, in this part we will jump around a bit more and look at several of the interesting moments that came about during the exercise.

# Communicating Classes

Our first concern was how to introduce classes when this became necessary--because the tests must be made to pass within the test method, we thought this would be tricky. However we realised that, when we want to split out an inner class to clean up an existing class, this can easily be achieved in the refactoring stage. [The `ResultChecker` class was extracted](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/commit/7a8486584e5d073d84f5fe2e301a9b8fd78b75bd) from the existing code as part of the refactoring, in line with rule 4.1 of [TDDAIYMI](https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/):

> You want a new class—wait until refactoring time, then… create non-test classes to provide a destination for a Move Method and for no other reason (populate implementation classes with methods by doing Move Method, and no other way)

Extraction of the `ResultChecker` class:

What about when the need for a class comes up that does something different to an existing class, so can’t simply be extracted from it? On [branch "attempt_002"](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/blob/attempt_002/nac.py) we stopped because we saw no immediate way to introduce further classes that we believed were required, the reason being that we could not think of a TDDAIYMI-compliant means to introduce the communication between classes. When we know we want to adopt an MVC design, how do we use TDDAIYMI to help us wire up the Model and View, via the Controller? They have to be able to communicate.

Fortunately the answer to this one is straightforward, too. Imagine that we have already separately developed the View and Model, and wish to write the Controller (this seems like a sufficiently bottom-up way of doing things, which we feel fits TDDAIYMI). In this case, we can write the tests for the wiring between the Model and View, making them pass within the test methods, as stipulated by the rules. It is fine for us to use the existing Model and View objects in the test methods, as they are already part of the established, tested, codebase. We will then start to be able to extract methods (as per rule 4.1).

> You want a new method—wait until refactoring time, then… create new (non-test) methods by doing one of these, and in no other way:
>
> - preferred: do Extract Method on implementation code created as per (3) to create a new method in the test class, or
> - if you must: move implementation code as per (3) into an existing implementation method

Ultimately, we will arrive at a point where a lot of related methods will be ripe for refactoring into a class (as per rule 4.2 above).

# Rookie Mistakes

One common error that we made during the exercise was to do a large refactoring in a single step. For example, in [94daea6](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/commit/94daea6de4c96c7d085893e3f5ab701d8f11b779) (below) we jumped straight to the extraction of a method for `is_legal()` without going through an intermediate step of refactoring the code to look the same in both cases. This would have left us a trivial extract-method refactoring. By doing the whole refactoring in a single step we run the risk of introducing errors, or at the very least having to go back and redo the refactoring when we get it wrong.

In this case, we should have first added the extension `and move < 9` to the `is_legal()` call and then used a refactoring to move the code into the production code.

# Rule Violations

One of the most common violations of ‘the rules’ of TDD was to modify the behaviour of code during a ‘refactoring’. This most commonly took the form of moving behaviour into existing methods.

For example, starting from the <span style="color: green;">GREEN</span> state ([7940ebb](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/commit/7940ebb724b878d75a2c6b84202a38991aaa5dd7), with the explicit `True`/`False` tests added for clarity):

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert is_legal(move) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert (is_legal(move) or move > 0) is True

def is_legal(move):
    return move == 0
```

we move directly to the following, in a single 'refactoring' ([ac29b93](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/commit/ac29b93507fe4dd1367043ffe0d7214b00be3f41), again with the explicit `True`/`False` tests added for clarity):

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert is_legal(move) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert is_legal(move) is True

def is_legal(move):
    return move == 0 or move > 0
```

What would have been the correct way of going about this change? One possible approach would be to make all of the uses of the method look the same first. Then extract a new method and inline the old one.

This would look something like the following.  Starting from the same <span style="color: green;">GREEN</span> state as above, we start by changing the assertion in `test_illegal_move_is_not_legal()` to match the form of that in `test_different_legal_move_is_legal()`:

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert (is_legal(move) or move > 0) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert (is_legal(move) or move > 0) is True

def is_legal(move):
    return move == 0
```

The assertion for `test_illegal_move_is_not_legal()` is clearly still valid.

We then refactor, step-by-step, staring by renaming the original `is_legal()` function:

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert (original_is_legal(move) or move > 0) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert (original_is_legal(move) or move > 0) is True

def original_is_legal(move):
    return move == 0
```

then extracting a new `is_legal()` function from the two tests:

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert is_legal(move) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert is_legal(move) is True

def is_legal(move):
    return original_is_legal(move) or move > 0

def original_is_legal(move):
    return move == 0
```

and finally, inlining the `original_is_legal()` function:

```python
def test_illegal_move_is_not_legal():
    move = -1
    assert is_legal(move) is False

def test_different_legal_move_is_legal():
    move = 1
    assert is_legal(move) is True

def is_legal(move):
    return move == 0 or move > 0
```

The result is the same as the single-step refactoring.

Another instance where we were a bit aggressive in the refactoring step was in [b873939](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/commit/b873939af49e97ec69eed930013de18e818affd0) (below) where we introduced the use of sets and the `any` function (which is nice and neat, but does alter the behaviour somewhat).

# Data vs Code

The approach we took to determining whether a position was a win in early attempts took the form of gradually building up example cases of win/not-win conditions and adding to the code that evaluated the position to pass the tests. This often got us into a very repetitive rut with the TDD process, where not much was added to the code, but we couldn’t seem to get off that path, as can be seen below.

In later attempts, for example [in our final run through](https://github.com/BillionthMonkey/NoughtsAndCrosses/blob/attempt_006_tddaiymi_2/nac.py), we moved to an approach of having a list of winning conditions as data, and wrote tests to drive a solution that looked to see if the win condition was contained in the list of winning conditions.

The later approach ends up with a much simpler and more flexible result, which would allow us to change the size of the board almost trivially. This level of flexibility could have been achieved in the algorithmic position evaluation too but would have required many more tests to get to that stage.

# Next Time

Next time we will look at a more traditional TDD approach (in a London/Mockist style--as we’re British) to this exercise and see how it compares and contrasts to the TDDAIYMI style of development.
