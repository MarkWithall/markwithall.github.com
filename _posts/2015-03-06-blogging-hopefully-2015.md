A somewhat late first article this year; as it’s just turned March.  To continue the trend from last year, I’m starting with a review and forecast.  Last year: seven out of twelve.  Not as good as the nine out of twelve for 2013 but not a complete disaster.  As usual, however, nearly all of the articles were written in the first half of the year.  This year, I’m still keeping the twelve article target and will try harder to get more in the second half.

I was happy with the articles I did write.  In particular, I enjoyed my investigation into implementing [Undo/Redo](/programming/2014/06/20/undo-redo.html); an area which has always been rather a mystery to me.  I had plenty to write about during the year but I failed to take advantage of all of the opportunities.

I already have a few articles in the works, for this year, that should give me a bit of a head start; including an exciting collaboration with [Matthew Tylee Atkinson](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk) on a series of articles about Keith Braithwaite’s [“TDD As If You Meant It”](http://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/) exercise.  It would also be a good idea to publish my long overdue full review of BACON 2014 before the 2015 event.
