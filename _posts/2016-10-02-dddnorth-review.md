Yesterday (1st October 2016) I braved the coldest morning for quite some time to make the long trek north to Leeds (a much nicer journey now most of the M1 is open) for [DDD North 2016](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk). I had been to the [2014](/programming/2014/10/19/dddnorth-review.html) edition of the conference and found it excellent value for the price (free), so I thought I'd go again this year.

Yet again, it was a great day (with the one exception of the increasingly unpleasant aroma from the gents restroom). Alas, I was forced to miss the final session of talks due to a prior engagement but the rest of the talks that I saw were excellent. It was also nice to catch up with my Northern colleagues, whom I hadn't seen for a while.

## This is not the Async you are looking for

This talk was by [Liam Westley](https://twitter.com/westleyl). I've not really played with `async/await` much as yet, so hopefully having watched this talk will prompt me to do so. In particular, it prompted me to look into [TPL Dataflow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh228603(v=vs.110).aspx). I also have to look at the white paper [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=19957). Liam also gave a very entertaining lunchtime talk on what the point of Microsoft is.

## 10 more things you need to do to succeed as a Tech Lead

This talk was by [Joel Hammond-Turner](https://twitter.com/Rammesses).  As I had not seen the first talk in this series, I gained 20 things, as the first 10 were summarised at the beginning. 
I'm sure the full list can be found upon the Internet but a couple of them persuaded me that I should probably do more logging than I currently do and that I should be more aware of the real cost of projects.

## Run Your Team Lean and Deliver More

This talk was by [Stephen Haunts](https://twitter.com/stephenhaunts). It was worth attending for the discovery of the [Derbyshire DotNet](https://derbyshiredotnet.co.uk) group alone.  That said, the rest of the talk was worthwhile to clarify in my mind Lean,  Kanban and related things.

## Take Control - Control Code Complexity

This talk was by [Fan Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fanyang2010). This talk suggested I read [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) by John Hughes (of Haskell fame). I was also pointed at Resharper's Cyclomatic Complexity checker, which I didn't know existed. The talk itself was very entertaining and practical; walking through example code and refactoring it to reduce cyclomatic complexity. The code for which can be found at her [GitHub](https://github.com/misssoft).

Overall the day was definitely worth the trip. Many thanks to all of the organisers and sponsors for making it happen.
